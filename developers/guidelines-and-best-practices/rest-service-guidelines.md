# REST service guidelines

## URI naming conventions
The recommended naming convention to use is the [REST Resource Naming Guide](https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/) from [REST API Tutorial](https://restfulapi.net/) when designing REST Services in Genus Apps.

## JSON naming conventions
There is no single naming convention standard for JSON. However, if no external requirments specify otherwise, we recommend using **camelCase** as the preferred naming standard for JSON in Genus Apps.
