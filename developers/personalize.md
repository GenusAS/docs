In the **Color Scheme** box in the section **Application**, select which theme colors to use as; **Default**<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">, ******Office 2007 Blue******, **Office 2007 Silver**, or **Office 2007 Black**.

Do one of the following:

*   Right-click the Genus icon in the notification area, and then on the shortcut menu, click **Hide When Minimized**.

## Change What Happens When Opening a Link

When opening a [link](how to/exchange data with other applications/copy and paste data.md) to an object, the main windows can be opened at the same time. This is useful if one frequently uses links, as it reduces the time it takes to open a link, after the first time. If the main window is not open when a link is used, the whole application is loaded before the target of the link is shown.

To change whether to open the main window minimized whenever a link is opened, do the following:

*   In the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.
*   To open the main window, in the **Application** section, select **Start main window when opening a link**<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">.
*   <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">To only open the link target, in the Application section, click to clear **Start main window when opening a link**<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">.
