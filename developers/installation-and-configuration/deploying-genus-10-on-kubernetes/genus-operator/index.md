# Genus Operator

Genus Operator replaces the old ``genus-kubernetes-operator-service``. When updating to Genus Operator, the old chart must manually be uninstalled, before Genus Operator can be deployed. 

There are several changes to how Genus Operator is configured. See [here](helm-values-description/index.md) for descriptions for the various configuration values, and [here](default-helm-values/index.md) to see the default Helm value file.
