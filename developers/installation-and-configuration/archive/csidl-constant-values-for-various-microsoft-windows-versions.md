# CSIDL Constant Values for Various Microsoft Windows Versions

In Microsoft Windows, CSIDL (constant special item ID list) values provide a unique system-independent way to identify special folders used frequently by applications, but which may not have the same name or location on any given system.

The CSIDL constants resolves to different folders on different versions of Microsoft Windows. Below you will find the values for a selection of CSIDL constants used by Genus.

**CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILES**: `C:\Program Files`

**CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA**: `C:\ProgramData`

**CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA**: `C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local`

All paths above refer to English versions of Microsoft Windows and may differ in other languages.
