# Composition

Object composition is a way and practice to combine simple objects into more complex ones. For example, the objects _wheel, steering wheel, seat, gearbox_ and _engine_ may have no functionality by themselves. But if you compose them, they may form an _automobile_ object. That is, an object which has a higher function (or greater than the sum of its parts).

Genus App Platform allows you to define an Object Class composed of other Object Classes to form a composition.
