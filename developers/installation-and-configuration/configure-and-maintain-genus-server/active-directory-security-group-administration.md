## Active Directory Security Group Administration

In order to streamline your security administration, or to comply with your organization's security requirements, you may want to handle your Genus App Services security group administration within **Active Directory**. In that case, the **Active Directory** security groups will be listed inside **Genus Studio**.

The following limitations and functionalities applies:

*   User memberships cannot be changed in **Genus Studio**. This must be done within your **Active Directory**.
*   In **Genus Studio**, you may assign which security group to use as the Administrator group.
*   You may also specify Data Set access.
*   The security group Everyone is still accessible within **Genus Studio**.
