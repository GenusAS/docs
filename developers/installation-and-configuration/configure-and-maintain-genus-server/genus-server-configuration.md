# Genus Server Configuration

The Genus Configuration application is installed on the application server as part of the app service installation. It lets you set up and configure the application server for your application.

To start the configuration application on the application server, press the windows button and type "genus configuration", and then start the application from the list.

The configuration is performed on three levels:

*   **Genus App Services Options** that apply to the application server.
*   **Genus Directory Properties** that apply to a specific application model accessed through the application server.
*   **Genus Data Set Properties** that apply to a specific set of data for an application.
