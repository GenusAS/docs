# Installation and configuration

A Genus app includes an application client installation, an application server installation, and a database. The application server installation must be accessible over an internet or other network connection for all client installations, and the database must be accessible for the application server. Special attention should be paid to the application server configurationf to ensure optimal performance and stability.
