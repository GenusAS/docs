## Date Time Edit

The date time edit combines the functionality of a single-line text editor, button editor and dropdown calendar with support for time input. The editor's dropdown displays a single-month calendar that allows end-users to select dates, and navigate through months and years. Specifying a date by selecting it on the calendar, or manual entry into the text box changes the editor's edit value.
