## Containers

Containers are used to divide the screen into smaller areas and group other controls. The containers can contain several other controls, and arrange them side-by-side, either horizontally or vertically. By using containers within containers with different orientation, flexible and complex layouts can be achieved. For more information, see [Layout](../view layout fundamentals.md).

There are four types of containers;

**Group**

The [group](containers/group.md) has no header, border, or background color, and is therefore a non-visible box which is useful to create areas on the screen without uneccessary clutter. The group control can easily be changed into a group box control.

**Group Box**

The [group box](containers/group box.md) has a header with title and a border. This makes it useful for creating logical groups with a name on the screen. The group box control can easily be changed into a group control.

**Conditional Groups**

[Conditional groups](containers/conditional groups.md) can contain a number of group or group box controls, and displays one of them at a given time. Which one of the groups that is displayed is determined by conditions, and the order of the groups.

**Tab Sheets**

[Tab sheets](containers/tab sheets.md) can contain other container controls and displays a tab for each of them. One tab can be active at a given time, and the corresponding container is then displayed with its content.
