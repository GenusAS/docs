## Timeline

<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">Use the timeline control to visualize a sequence of events or a timelines in a user friendly manner. <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">Present various occurences like business events, project events, or observations related to a criminal investigation. The events can have a duration or not, and can be placed in a groups for improved readability. Unlike the Gantt control, which requires one recursive data source, the timeline control can visualize event from several different data sources.

**Series**

Add a series for each data source to visualize, and specify how to visually represent the data in the timeline.

**Views**

Add different views for different sets of series, and which of them is the default. Specify which series to show in a view, and how to scroll, zoom, perform grouping, etc. Also specify which time units to allow, for example day, Month, and year, or hour and minute.
