## Data Sorting

Defines the default sort order used when displaying objects from the Object Class in forms and tables. The data are sorted by the selected properties in the order shown.

1.  To add a property, click **Add**.
2.  In the **Sort by Property** dialog box, select a property and choose if the data should be sorted in ascending or descending order.

To change the order the properties are sorted by, click a property in the list, and then click **Move Up** or **Move Down**.

**Note**. If a property is an outbound reference to a code domain, data are sorted according to the logical sort order defined for the code domain. For example, in a code domain which defines some kind of workflow status, the codes may be specified in the following order: _Not Started_, _In Progress_ and _Completed_.
