## Display

**Allow list all objects**

Select this option to allow users to view all objects from the Object Class in dialogs and list boxes used for selecting objects. This option is best used on Object Classes with a small amount of data where you do not want to display a search dialog for selecting objects.

**Naming**

Text used to identify an object, for example, the _article number_ and _name_ of a _product_. The name identify an object to the user, and does not have to be unique. To define a name for an object, add one or more properties from the Object Class. For a given object, the name is constructed by concatenating the values for the selected properties. For example:

_38-2450 32'' LCD TV_

**Screen Tip**

Text displayed when the user hovers the mouse over a graphical user interface control associated with the Object Class. To define a screen tip, add one or more properties from the Object Class which summarize essential information for an object. For a given object, the screen tip is constructed by concatenating the name and the value for the selected properties. For example:

_Article No = 38-2450_

_Name = 32'' LCD TV_

_Category = TV and DVD_

_Price = b, 1,500_

**Symbol**

To select a symbol for the Object Class, click **Change** and select a bitmap file. The size of the bitmap file can be a maximum of 16x16 pixels.
