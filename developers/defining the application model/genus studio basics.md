## Genus Studio Basics

Genus App Platform employs declarative data about your business objects, logic, and user interface. This collection of [metadata](glossary.md) are stored in the directory for your application and maintained in **Genus Studio**. From the first moment you start describing the necessary metadata, your application is alive. This truly supports scenario and evolutionary driven capture of critical functionality.

When you make changes in your directory, these changes have to be deployed to clients connected to your application server(s), and when the version is deployed, all signed in users are forced to restart their client.
