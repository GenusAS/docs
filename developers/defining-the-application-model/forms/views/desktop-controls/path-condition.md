## Path Condition

A path condition defines the path from one object class to another, via other object classes if necessary. The step between two object classes is defined by conditions between the properties of the two object classes. In database terms this would be referred to as "a join" between two object classes.

To add a step in the path condition, do the following:

1.  The current object class in the path is shown on the left, and the operator in the middle box is <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Join with. To select the object class to join with in the box on the right, do this:
2.  Click the down arrow and then click **Select Field or Group**.

3.  In the list, select the correct object class.
4.  In the immediately followin **By** section, define the condition between the two object classes. To enter conditions for more than one set of proerties, click **Add>>**.
