## File Browser Edit

The file browser edit combines the functionality of a single-line text editor with a button to open a file browser window. The control contains a URL to a file, for example on a disk or on a share. The file URL can be edited textually in the box, or the file browser can be opened and a file URL is selected by selecting a file.

The control can be bound to a field with data interpretation File URL.
