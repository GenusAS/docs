## Form Designer

Use the form designer to define a form by adding the data sources to use, one or more views, the events to react to, and any local tasks.

To edit a form in the designer, go to the list of forms in Genus Studio, locate the form, and double click it, or right click and select **Open**.

To view the form definition in a read only mode, press and hold the CTRL+SHIFT keys when opening the form. This prevents the form from being locked for other modelers, and it is not possible to save any changes to the form.
