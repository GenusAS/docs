## Views

A view specifies the visual content and appearance of a form, by defining the layout of controls which present various elements of data. The layout offers a high degree of flexibility, which demands a well thought-through design. For fundamental information on createing layouts, see [View Layout Fundamentals](views/view-layout-fundamentals.md).

A form requires one view, but can contain many. By defining more than one view in a form, the definition of data sources, tasks, and events can be re-used while each view focuses on different requirements. For example, different views can target different user groups, different stages in a process, or different aspects of the data.

By using [events](events.md) that trigger [commands](commands.md) with the effect types Swich View and Open View, the perceived complexity of a form can be reduced. Use switch view to change from one view to another which shows other parts of the data or a different presentation of the same data. Use open view similarly, for example to show detailed information in a new window.

To see if a view is used within the form, right click the view , and click **Find Local References**.
