## Distribution of Reports

Distribution is the act of scattering or spreading out. Genus allows you to distribute reports by making or spreading out copies for a selection of data filter objects.

The copies may be printed, saved as files or sent to mail recipients.

The default behaviour is to make one copy of your report, applying a set of objects as one data filter to this one copy. This behaviour is identical to first opening the report, specifying the data filter within the report, and then printing, saving or sending the report.

However, by using distribution, you may make several copies of your report, by iterating over your set of objects one object at a time, i.e. making one copy of the report per data filter object.

If your report has more than one data source, you may even make copies for every combination of objects from the data sources, like making copies of a revenue report for each combination of your departments and each of the last months. In such an example, with 10 departments and 3 months, this would produce 30 copies, each with a different set of data filter objects applied.

To make an report available for distribution, define a link to it by following these steps:

*   [Open the Object Class for modification](../../../data/object-class/modify-an-object-or-identifier-domain.md).
*   Click the **Explore** tab.
*   [Add a link to the report](../../../object-class/modify-an-object--or-identifier-domain/explore.md).
