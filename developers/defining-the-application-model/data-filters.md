## Data Filters

A Data Filter is used to define a set of objects which can be used as groups in reports. A data filter can be defined as a static selection of objects, a dynamic criteria, or as a combination of other data filters.

Data Filters can for example be used in an accounting system, to create groups of accounts that are not available in the system, but are required for special reporting purposes. These account groups can be selections of accounts, or extra attributes may be added to allow the end users to dynamically include or exclude accounts, using criteria based data filters.
