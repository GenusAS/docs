# Release notes

Explore the menu to the left to learn about all user-visible changes to Genus Apps from one release to the next.
 
The release notes will be updated prior to a release and may also be updated as long as the release is available, e.g. with information of new patches or known issues. A change log is available at the end of each release note.

For general information about our release stages, have a look [here](release-stages.md).

Forward-looking statements like our roadmap is available [here](https://www.genus.no/?PageKey=e8d60929-9dd5-42bb-858e-bb7adf421fa3).

Breaking changes and deprecated functionality are first annonuced in the roadmap and will appear in the release notes closer to the release date.

_Note: The release notes are currently being moved to this (docs.genus.no) site and during the transition period you may find release notes both here and at the [old site](https://www.genus.no/?PageKey=3afcf63a-acd1-4f47-9eb7-e6a68e7eafd8)). We are sorry for the inconvenience._
