# Desktop controls

The controls are the building blocks in a form. Container Controls are used to divide the screen into smaller areas and group other controls. The common controls display fields from the data sources, and the Reporting and Visualization Controls present aggregated data and other visual representation of the data.

Most controls share a set of general properties which are described in [Control properties](desktop-controls/common-control-properties.md), while the control specific properties are described for each individual control.
