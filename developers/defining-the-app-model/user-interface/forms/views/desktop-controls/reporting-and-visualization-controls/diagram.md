# Diagram

The diagram control offers clear presentation of complex networks, with interaction to modify the objects and relationships, or create new ones. The control supports any number of types of objects and relationships, which can be formatted individually to increase the visual recognition.

**Nodes**

Define two or more nodes. Each node represents a type of object to visualize in the diagram.

**Edges**

Define the edges, which represents the relationships between nodes. Each node should typically have at least one edge, but may have more. An edge connects a source node with a target node, through a connection path which may involve additional data sources.

**Layouts**

A layout contains the basic settings for how the nodes and edges are organized in the diagram. One or more layouts must be defined.  

**Views**  
A view defines which nodes and edges are relevant, and how they are laid out. One or more views must be defined.
