## Flags

Use flags to add a remark on an object. A flag is defined by a subject and a flag color. Flag colors are ranked by importance in the following order:

*   Red (high importance)
*   Yellow
*   Green
*   White (low importance)

Flags for an object appears in forms and tables. If more than one flag is added to an object, the flag with highest importance is displayed in tables.

Flags can be added on all objects by specifying a condition which must be satisfied for the flag to be displayed. For example, you can add a flag on all customers with payments placed for collection.

To add a flag on all objects for this Object Class, do the following:

1.  In the **Flags** list, click **Add**.
2.  In the **Flag** dialog box, type a subject in the **Subject** box.
3.  In the **Flag Color** box, select a flag color indicating the importance for the flag.
4.  Optionally type a description in the **Description** box.
5.  To display the flag in the information bar when an object is opened, select the **Show flag in the information bar when the object is opened** check box.
6.  In the section **Show this flag if the following condition is true**, click **Change** to enter a [condition](../../../common-concepts/conditions.md "Conditions") that must be satisifed for any given object if the flag should be displayed.
