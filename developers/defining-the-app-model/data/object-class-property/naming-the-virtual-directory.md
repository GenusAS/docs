# Naming the Virtual Directory

During installation Genus App Services creates a web site on your application server. Genus App Services requires a unique virtual directory within this web site. This virtual directory must also be unique for each Data Set.

Your Genus desktop client application will be available to your end users by the address given by the combination of the protocol (https), an internet host name and a virtual directory, ie _https://yourserver.yourdomain.com/yourapplication_, where _yourserver.yourdomain.com_ is the internet host name and _yourapplication_ is the virtual directory entered for your data set(s).
