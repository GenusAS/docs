# Merge data to a Microsoft Excel document

[The merge effect](../../../defining-an-app-model/logic/action-orchestration/actions/effects/merge-data-to-a-document.md "The Merge Data to a Document Effect") allows you to merge data in Excel workbooks similar to the mail merge feature in Microsoft Word. Specifically, the merge effect allows you to automatically copy data into your Excel workbooks while retaining the layout, formatting and formulas in your workbooks.

The output of the merge operation is not confined to the Microsoft Excel Document format. You can save the merged document to any of the following file formats:

*   Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF)
*   HTML
*   Microsoft Excel (XLS, XLSX, XLSM, XLTX, XLTM, XLSB, XML)
*   Open Document Text (ODT)
*   Plain Text (TXT)
*   Rich Text Format (RTF)
*   XML Paper Specification (XPS)
