# Trusted users

> [!NOTE]
> Access given to trusted users is replaced by [app model admin rights](app-model-administrators.md) in version 2018.2.

To provide functionality to the end user, Genus Apps employs declarative data about your business objects and logic. This collection of [metadata](../../../terminology.md#metadata) is stored in the app model for your application and maintained in Genus Studio.

Only trusted users can modify this part of the app model.

Trusted users are selected as part of the [step-by-step configuration of Genus Services](../../installation-and-configuration/configure-and-maintain-genus-server/configure-genus-server--step-by-step.md#step-11---create-trusted-users).
