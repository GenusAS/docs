# App model administrators

> [!NOTE]
> App model admin rights replaces the access given to [trusted users](trusted-users.md) in versions prior to 2018.2. 

To provide functionality to the end user, Genus Apps employs declarative data about your business objects and logic. This collection of [metadata](../../../terminology.md#metadata) is stored in the app model for your application and maintained in Genus Studio.

Only users with app model admin rights can modify this part of the app model. To grant app model admin rights to a user, [follow these steps](security-groups-and-user-accounts.md#grant-app-model-admin-rights-to-a-user-account).
