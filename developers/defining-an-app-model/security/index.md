# Security

A successful app must ensure that only properly authenticated users can sign in to the app, and that app resources (data and functions) is available only to authorized users. User authentication confirms the identity of any user trying to sign in to an app and lets users access app resources. User authorization secures resources from unauthorized access. After a user account has received authentication and can potentially access an object, the type of access actually granted is determined by what [privileges](security-privileges.md) are assigned to the user and which [permissions](security-permissions.md) are attached to the objects the user wants to access.

The security services provided by Genus Apps are based on Microsoft Active Directory mechanisms, and may optionally be integrated with an Active Directory-based domain controller.
