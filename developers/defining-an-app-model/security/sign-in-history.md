# Sign In History

Whenever a user attempts to sign in, certain details about the attempt are stored in the account session history, or sign in history.

The information stored in the sign in history includes, for example:

*   User Account
*   User Name
*   Date and Time
*   The state of the sign in attempt (Authorized, Invalid Username, Invalid Password, etc.)
*   Session Type (Desktop, App, Studio, Other)

The sign in history is available to search and list, by users with the following privileges:

*   Open Studio
*   Manage Users
*   Combine Event History for all Users

To search the sign in history, [open Studio](../getting-started/how-to-open-genus-studio.md), and in the navigation pane locate the **History** entry and then then **Sign In History** entry.

Over time the sign in history will take up much space, and in many cases it is necessary to schedule regular deletion of the oldest account session history entries.
