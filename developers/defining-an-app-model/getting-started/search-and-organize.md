# Search and organize

The search and organize features in Genus Studio help you readily find, sort and organize your model objects.

## Metadata

In addition to the actual content of a model object, there is information about the object itself. Genus Studio keeps track of details about each model object, for example when it was created and when it was last modified. You can also store extra details for an object, such as category, tags, comments, owner and delegate.

Metadata that can be assigned to a model object:

| Name        | Description                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Groups      | >Groups are primarily used to break up content into broadly identifiable selections. While not being highly effective for finding specific information, it can help users to filter out somewhat irrelevant data. |
| Tags        | A tag is a keyword or term which helps describe an object and allows it to be found by browsing or searching. You can assign as many tags as you want to a model object. |
| Comments    | |
| Owner       | |
| Delegate    | |

To add or modify metadata for a model object, right-click the model object, click **Properties** and locate the **Details** tab.

## Groups

Groups are primarily used to break up content into broadly identifiable selections. While not being highly effective for finding specific information, it can help you  filter out somewhat irrelevant data.

To group one or more objects in the same group, select model objects, right-click the selection, and click **Change Group**. If you do not want the selected objects to be grouped, click **None**.

Model object selection is only available in _tables_ listing model objects.

If you want to create a new group, right-click a model object, click **Properties**, and in the **Details** tab, click the Group drowdown and select **Create a New Group**.

You may also in the **Tools** menu select **Groups and Tags...**. This dialog allows you to create (by right-clicking), delete (by right-clicking) and renaming (press **F2**) both groups and tags.

Note that when you remove a group or tag, the group or tag is removed from all objects which have this group or tag assigned.

## Tags

A tag is a keyword or term which helps describe an object and allows it to be found by browsing or searching. You can assign as many tags as you want to an object.



**Add Tags to Objects**

<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Tag one or more objects with the same tags:

1.  In the **Directory Explorer**, select the objects which you want to tag.
2.  In the **Actions** menu, click **Add Tag**.
3.  In the **Available Tags** list, click a tag and then click **Select**. To select more than one tag, press the CTRL key and click multiple tags.

If you want to create a new tag, click <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Create a New Tagin the **Available Tags** list.

<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Tag an object using the property dialog box:

1.  In the **Directory Explorer**, right-click an object to apply properties, and then in the shortcut menu, click **Properties**.
2.  Click the **Details** tab.
3.  In the **Tags** box, select one or more tags from the list. If you want to create a new tag, simply type the name of the new tag in the **Tags** box.

When you save a new object, you can tag the object from the **Tag** box in the **Save As** dialog.

**Remove Tags from Objects**

1.  In the **Directory Explorer**, right-click the objects which you want to remove a tag from, and then in the shortcut menu point to **Remove Tag** and click the tag you want to remove.

**Add and Modify Tags**

1.  In the **Tools** menu, click **Groups and Tags**.
2.  Click the **Tags** tab.
3.  In the **Tags** list, right-click a tag and in the shortcut menu click **Create Tag** and then type a name for the tag.

If you add a lot of tags, you might discover that it is difficult to keep track of a long list of tags. If you have group of related tags, you might want to nest them instead. Consider, for example, this set of tags in a resource management system:

*   Request
*   Order
*   Resource

You might want to nest these tags to a top-level tag named <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Staffing. When you search for objects tagged with <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Staffing, all objects tagged with the top-level tag and any of the nested tags are returned.

To nest tags, do one of the following:

*   Right-click the top-level tag, and then in the shortcut menu, click **Create Tag**.
*   Drag a tag that you want to be nested to the tag that you want to make the top-level tag.

**Tip**. To create a nested tag when typing tags in the **Details** tab in the property dialog box for an object, or in the **Save As** dialog box, use a slash (/). For example, type <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Staffing/Order to create the <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Order tag and nest it to the <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Staffing tag. If the <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Staffing tag does not already exist, it will be created automatically.



## Search

**Instant Search**

In the **Instant Search** box located at the top right-corner of the **Directory Explorer** window you can enter part of a word, a word, or a phrase. Instant Search rapidly searches names, metadata such as tags and categories, and other properties, and returns the objects found. For example, entering your name in the Instant Search Field results in a list of objects related to you, objects where you are the owner or delegate, and objects you have created or modified.

**Advanced Search**

If you want to search more selectively, you can use **Advanced Search** to specify which properties to search. To open the **Advanced Search** pane, in the **Instant Search** pane, click **Advanced Search**![IDD26AE9CB627245CE.ID5FCF2C2BADC34346.jpg](media/IDD26AE9CB627245CE.ID5FCF2C2BADC34346.jpg).

In the search fields, type your search text. In some search fields, such as date and account fields, you can select predefined search values such as **Me**, **Last Week, This Year** etc. To change the search operator (equal to, containing etc.) for a field, click the name of the field, and then in the list, click an operator.

To display more search fields, click **Fields** and then in the list, click a field. To remove a search field, click the name of the field, and then in the list, click **Remove**. The setup is saved in your personal profile, and persists after you exit and restart the Genus desktop client.

**Reuse a Recent Search**

To reuse a recent search, click the arrow in the **Instant Search** box, in the menu point to **Recent Searches**, and then click a search. Genus Studio displays up to 10 of your most recent searches.

**Search as You Type**

By default, Genus will start to search as you type, and there is no need to press Enter to display results.

## View Settings

The layout for all views in the Directory Explorer can be customized to suit your preferences. A view is composed of fields and settings controlling the way objects are sorted and grouped. The settings are stored as part of your personal setup.
