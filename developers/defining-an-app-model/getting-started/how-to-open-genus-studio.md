# How to open Genus Studio

[Genus Studio](../../../terminology.md#genus-studio) is Genus Apps' client for defining and maintaining an [app model](../../../terminology.md#app-model).

Genus Studio opens from [Genus Desktop](../../../terminology.md#genus-desktop).

In the **File** menu in Genus Desktop, click **Application** and then **Start Genus Studio**.

If you have not been granted access to Genus Studio, the menu item will not be available. Please contact your system adminstrator to gain access.

It is possible to open Genus Studio directly from a Windows shortcut or url, if you have been provided with one from your system administrator. To learn how to create such a shortcut, see [here](how-to-create-shortcuts-to-genus-studio-or-genus-desktop.md).
