# Getting started

Genus Apps employs declarative data about your business objects, logic, and user interface. This collection of [metadata](../../../terminology.md) are stored in the directory for your application and maintained in Genus Studio.

When you make changes in your directory, these changes have to be deployed to clients and app services. A deployment forces a restart of the clients and the app services.
