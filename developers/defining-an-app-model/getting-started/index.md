# Getting started

Genus Apps employs declarative data about your business objects, logic, and user interface. This collection of [metadata](../../../terminology.md) are stored in an app model and maintained in Genus Studio.

When you make changes in your app model, these changes have to be deployed to clients and services. A deployment forces a restart of the clients and services.
