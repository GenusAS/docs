# REST service uri path segments

_The content is under construction. We are sorry for the inconvenience._

See [Common URI path segments](../index.md#common-uri-path-segments) for more information about the common URI path segments.

## Specific path segments for REST services
The URI for the REST service is `<common-path-segments>/rest/<service-name>/<resource-path>?<query-params>`, where _service-name_, _resource-path_ and _query-params_ are defined in the REST Service in Genus Studio. See [REST Service Guidelines](../../../guidelines-and-best-practices/rest-service-guidelines.md) for best practices for setting up these path elements.
