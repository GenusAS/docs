# REST services

_The contents is under constructions and is incomplete. We are sorry for the inconvenience._

Before consuming or exposing REST services using Genus App Platform, we recommend reading _[A Guide to Designing and Building RESTful Web Services with WCF 3.5](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd203052)_. In particular, we recommend paying attention to the principles the guide communicates, like the resource-oriented aspects of REST services and the emphasize on _nouns_ instead of _verbs_.

How to consume REST services external to your Genus solution (i.e. calling REST services from your Genus solution) is covered [here](../../logic/action-orchestration/actions/effects/consume-a-rest-service.md).

Exposing REST services from your Genus solution is fully supported, but not yet documented. This part of the documentation is under construction.
