**Granting of Permissions to Security Groups**

To allow granting of permissions to individual security groups, select the **Allow granting of permissions to property** check box. Only [trusted users](../../../security/trusted-users.md "Trusted Users") can grant permissions to a property. How to grant permissions to a property is described in the article [Grant Permissions to a Property to a Security Group](../../../security/security-permissions.md "Grant Permissions to a Property to a Security Group").
