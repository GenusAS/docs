## Data Exchange - Microsoft Outlook - Mail Mail Messages

Data Exchange for Microsoft Outlook Mail Messages enables the users to reply and forward directly to e-mails attached to an object. This is only available for object classes which is defined with an attached file or e-mail. For more information see [Attach a File or an E-mail To an Object](../../../../how-to/attach-a-file-or-an-email-to-an-object.md "Attach a File or an E-mail To an Object"). The reply or forwarded e-mail can automatically be saved as a new object alongside the original e-mail. The new e-mail can be composed by using values from both the original object and the replied or forwarded message.
