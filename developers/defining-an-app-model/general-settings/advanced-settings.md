## Full Text Search (Oracle)

For full text queries using the NEAR operator, you can specify the maximum distance allowed between two words. The NEAR operator returns a score based on the proximity of two or more query terms. Users can override this setting.

Default value: 100.

Minimum value: 3.

## Sentry Error Reporting (Web)

If the Genus web app crashes, it will send an error report to our developers as a default. If you type an address in **Sentry DNS Override**, the error report will be sent to this address instead.

To disable Sentry error reporting, select the **Disable Sentry** check box.
