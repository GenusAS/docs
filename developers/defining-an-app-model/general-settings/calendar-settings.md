# Calendar Settings

Except for the start and end year, the default settings for the calendar applies in most cases.

**Start Year**

First available year in the calendar.

**End Year**

Last available year in the calendar.

**Use Non-Calendar Year**

A common use of a non-calendar year is the fiscal year. A fiscal year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements. In many jurisdictions, regulatory laws regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year. To use a non-calendar year, you must specify the first month in the year.

**Divide Year in 52 Weeks**

Select this option to make it easier to compare data for the last week of the year for consecutive years. This may result in a first week or a last week with more than 7 days.

**Varying Number of Weeks**

Number of weeks follows the calendar year (52 or 53 weeks).

*   **Min Days in First Week**. The minimum allowed number of days in the first week of the year in order to constitute a whole week. The default setting is 4\. That is, each week is associated with the year in which Thursday occurs.
*   **Min Days in Last Week**. The minimum allowed number of days in the last week of the year in order to constitute a whole week. The default setting is 4\.
*   **Zero Week Day Limit**. If the number of days in the first week of the year is less than this limit, week number zero will be used for this week. It the limit equals zero, week number one will be used for the first week of the year. The default setting is 3.

**First Day in Week**

The first day in the week, which is Sunday in most countries. Nordic countries use Monday as the first day of the week. the default setting is Monday.
