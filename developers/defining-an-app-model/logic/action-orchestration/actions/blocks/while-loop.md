To specify advanced operations, the while loop is used in combination with effects, controls, and other blocks. See also these articles for information on making [decisions](decision.md), [enumerating](enumerator.md) over more than one object, [redirecting](../controls/redirect-execution.md) the execution flow, and [committing](scope.md) changes to data.
