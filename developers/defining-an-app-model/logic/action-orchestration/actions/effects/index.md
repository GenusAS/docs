# Effects

An effect is used to perform a specific task within a a sequence of actions.

Depending on where an effect is defined, only a subset of the effects described below are available. For example, effects that require user input, such as **Open a Form** or **Show an Information Message**, are only available for Tasks with the **Enable Run on Application Server** check box cleared. Tasks with this setting, and Agents, Web Services and Rules are executed without any user response.
