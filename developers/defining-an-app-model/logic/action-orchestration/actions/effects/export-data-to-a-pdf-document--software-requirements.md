# Export Data to a PDF Document - Software Requirements

When you export data to a PDF Document, in most cases please note the following software requirements:

*   **Exporting data from a Task**: Adobe Acrobat version 5.0 or greater, or Ghostscript must be installed on your computer.
*   **Exporting data from an Agent or a Web Service**: Ghostscript must be installed on the Application Server.

Note: Exporting data from tables and reports in normal view to PDF Document, do not require Adobe Acrobat or Ghostscript.

Ghostscript is a suite of software based on an interpreter for the Adobe Systems' PostScript (TM) and Portable Document Format (PDF) page description languages.
