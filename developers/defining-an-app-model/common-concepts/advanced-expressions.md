# Advanced expressions

The Advanced Expressions in Genus Apps are declarative, and you may express formulas consisting of functions, references to other fields or groups, static values (such as a number) and mathematical operators.

All functions and values are members of a data type, and there are two kinds of members:

*   Type members: The function or value may only be used on the type itself, i.e. on the type or class level. Example: *String.new*.
*   Instance members: The function or value may only be used on an instance or object of the type. Example: *Company.Name.toLower*.

Advanced Expressions are case sensitive.
