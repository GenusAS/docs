# Web apps

A web app is a responsive application which runs in a web browser. A web app can have multiple destinations for interacting with the user, where each destination is represented by a web component, such as a form, an analysis, a map, or a diagram. Users can navigate to different destinations from the navigation menu, or by running navigation actions attached to UI elements such as a button.

When building a web app, there are a number of well-known guides to follow. One is to keep the app as focused as possible. An app that has a specific, focused purpose can be optimized in many aspects such as content, device support, and means of interaction. However, enterprise solutions tend to try to cover a lot of purposes. Building a single app for every purpose will lead to many apps. Normally this is a challenge, but since we have a single shared app model you can easily allow users to navigate between the apps defined in your app model. That is, you can combine single purpose apps into a multi-purpose enterprise solution.

A web app is composed of three main elements:

* The app bar
* The navigation drawer
* A content area 

## App bar
The app bar which appears at the top of the screen is used for branding, navigation, search, and built-in actions.

## Navigation drawer
The navigation drawer provides access to destinations in the app. It can either be permanently on-screen, or controlled by the navigation menu icon in the app bar. The navigation drawer is displayed to the left side of the content.

The navigation drawer contains a menu including folders and entries to various web components defined in your app model, such as a form.

## Content area
When a user selects an entry in the navigation menu, or navigates to a web component by running a navigation action, the content for the web component is displayed in this area. The content area is located to the right of the navigation drawer.
