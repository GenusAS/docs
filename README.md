# Genus docs
This is the publically available documentation for the Genus App Platform&copy;.

Feel free to contribute by submitting pull requests. Employees of Genus may commit directly. All pull requests and commits are reviewed by the internal Genus editorial board.

See www.genus.no for more general information about our products and our company.

## Contributor guidelines

Our guidelines are as follows:
* Keep the articles short and to the point.
* It is better to start out small and then iterate and evolve more content later.
* Commit consistent and complete articles. If it isn't possible, state clearly in the article that the content is unfinished. Please return to finish it as soon as possible.
* Use images sparingly, as these are hard to maintain over time. Put any images in the images subfolder of your article. If you are submitting a screen shot, make sure that it doesn't contain any customer specific information.
* If you are unsure of the article content, spelling, or otherwise, submit a pull request and our editors will help you out.

* If you are making substantial changes to an existing article or a series of articles or adding several new articles, you need to fork this repository, install Git for revision control, a Markdown editor (like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) for previewing, and more.
