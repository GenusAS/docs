# Number Format

[Values](../concepts/value.md) which are numeric can be assigned a *Number Format*

The *Number Formats* follow one of these rules.

* **0** - Integer number.
* **0,0** - Integer number with thousand separator.
* **0 %** - Percentage. The value is multiplied with 100 before being displayed.

To display decimals, select a format with a dot and the desired number of decimals, e.g **0,0.00** for a floating point value with thousand separators and two decimals.
