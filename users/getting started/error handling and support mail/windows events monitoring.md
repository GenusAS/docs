## Windows Events Monitoring

We recommend frequently viewing or automatically monitoring your Genus App Services application server Windows Event logs **Genus App Services** and **Application**.

There should not be any errors or warnings in these logs.

We recommend monitoring these logs, since it may happen that Genus App Services logs events that is unnoticeable for your users, or your users experience incidents, but do not report them.

Some Windows events are expected during Genus App Services upgrades or Windows updates, since services tend to be unreachable for a short time during such operations. Therefore, always compare any events date and time with your maintenance windows.
