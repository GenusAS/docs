# Overview

All kinds of business software may be built on top of Genus App Platform, and it is not possible to describe your specific solution here. So if you are looking for more details, please consult the documentation provided by your IT department or your vendor.

However, certain end user functionalities are common across all Genus solutions. These are described here, and may apply to your solution.

The documentation currently covers the functionality provided in Genus Desktop. Documentation of Genus Apps will be included later.
