# What is a Genus solution?

A Genus solution is a software application built on top of Genus App Platform. Genus solutions are built for businesses in a variety of industries, their employees and their partners to support their combined work processes. Genus solutions are characterized as easier and faster to change than both standard packaged applications and traditionally custom-made (programmed) applications.

Genus solutions range from small web apps or mobile apps to large business critical core systems. Examples of Genus solutions are:
* Time capture on web
* Operational control and monitoring (e.g. checklists) on tablet and phone devices
* Employee and customer surveys
* Food safety and risk management
* Corporate performance management (CPM)
* Investigation support
* Anti-money laundring case handling
* Search apps
* Order and assignment management
* Commissions management
* Customer relationship management (CRM)

...and more.
