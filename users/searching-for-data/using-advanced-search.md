## Using Advanced Search

Advanced Search allows you to perform a search using [conditions](../../developers/defining-an-app-model/common-concepts/conditions.md "Conditions"). This is useful to express more advanced search criteria to find objects. You can combine different criteria using the And / Or operands, and collect the search result in one search operation.

To search with Advanced Search, do the following:

1.  In the **search** field, click ![ID92AE380C7C434746.ID9233578A6E3140F8.png](media/ID92AE380C7C434746.ID9233578A6E3140F8.png) and in the menu click **Advanced Search**.
2.  In the **Advanced Search** dialog box, set the conditions for the search. For more information, see [Condition Editor](../../developers/defining-an-app-model/common-concepts/conditions/condition-editor.md "Condition Editor").
3.  Click **OK**.

In this example, the search is for Employees in Executive or Finance departments, that have their 30th birthday today.
