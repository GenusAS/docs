# Getting started

Genus Desktop is an application client which requires installation on your computer. The client requires a connection to the relevant application services (Genus App Services) over a local network or the internet. Genus App Services must be installed on one or more Windows servers. For more information on system requirements, server installation and configuration, and client installation, see [Installation and Configuration](../developers/installation-and-configuration/index.md).
