# Data mart calculated fields

A calculated field is an extension of a data source locally in a data mart. They are defined as a mathematical formula.
Calculated fields are normally used when a mathematical operation needs to be performed at object level, as opposed to a [Formula](../analysis/concepts.md#formula) in an analysis which operates on an aggregated level.
