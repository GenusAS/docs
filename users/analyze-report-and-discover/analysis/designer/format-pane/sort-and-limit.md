# Sort and limit 

Sorting and limiting can be applied to values on a per category basis. Many sorts can applied to values based or category or value fields depending on the visualisation being used.

For example we could sort products by units_sold descending, then limit to 10, to get the top 10 products by sale amount
## Limit to first n values

number can be chosen to limit how many values should be in the visualisation

## Show remaining values as 

Replace cut off values with a chosen values

## Sort by state 

Sort values by selected values first

## Add sorting for *category/value*

Add a sort algorithm to the values with the chosen options
#### Sort
choose ascending/descending

#### Sort by
choose the category/value field by which to sort by
