# Required Selection

*Required selection* allows the user to set datasource selection rules on the tile. Until the selection are made ie the requirements are met, the tile will not display.

This means there must another tile within the analysis to make the selections on, otherwise the requirements will never be met and the tile wont display anything

The user can choose a datasource, minimum and maximum to define the requirement.

There is no limit on how many requirements can be set on a tile.
