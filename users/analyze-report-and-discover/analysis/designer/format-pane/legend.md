# Legend

Many visualisations can use a legend to display more information regarding the data being represented. 
The options available for legend are legend position which determines where the legend will be displayed 
within the tile. Generally the options available are Left, Right, Bottom and Top. Then there is Hidden 
and Default, typically the default setting is to hide the legend also.

One special case where the options are slightly different but still very similar is on a Map. The options 
available on Map are Top left, Bottom left, Top right and Bottom right.
