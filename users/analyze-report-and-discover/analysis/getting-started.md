# Getting started

You need a [data mart](../data-marts/index.md) to create an analysis. It's from the data mart your analysis gets its data.  
To create a data mart, see [Data mart - getting started](../data-marts/getting-started.md).  

If you are having trouble with your data mart, see [Data mart troubleshooting FAQ](../data-marts/data-mart-problemsolving-faq.md).

Once you have a data mart, you can create a new (or open an existing) analysis by doing the following:
* Open Genus Desktop
* Open the Discovery portal by clicking on *Discovery* in the bottom left menu
* Click on **Analysis** in the Discovery portal menu
* Create a new analysis by clicking **New** in the toolbar, or by right-clicking in the list of analyses and clicking **New**. (You can also do this via **File** -> **New** -> **New Analysis**)
	* Select the data mart you want your analysis to get data from
	* You can now start [designing your analysis](./designer/index.md) by clicking on the lowermost button on the left side pane - this will show the analysis layout
* Open an existing analysis by double-clicking the desired analysis from the list or finding it under **Recent Items** (You can also do this via **File** -> **Open** -> **Analysis**)
