# Getting started


An Analysis gets its data from a Data Mart.
If you have yet to create a data mart; [see here](../data-marts/index.html).

To open an existing analysis or create a new analysis, navigate to the [Discovery Portal]().
In the Discovery Portal you can also browse existing data marts.
