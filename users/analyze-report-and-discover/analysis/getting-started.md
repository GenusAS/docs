# Getting started

Before you can create an Analysis, you need a [Data Mart]((../data-marts/index.md)). If you haven't already created a Data Mart, see [Data Mart - Getting started](../data-marts/getting-started.md).  
If you have troubles with your Data Mart, see [Data Mart Trobuleshooting FAQ]((../data-marts/getting-started.md))

Once you have a Data Mart, you can create a new (or open an existing) Analysis by doing the following:
* Open Genus Desktop
* Open the Discover Pane by clicking on View -> Discover (or by pressing CTRL+D)
* Create a new Analysis by clicking 'New Analysis'
	* Select the Data Mart you want your analysis to get data from
	* You can now start [designing your Analysis](./designer/index.md) by clicking on the lowermost button on the left side pane - this will show the Analysis layout
* Open an existing Analysis clicking 'Open' or finding it under 'Recent Items'
