# Analysis concepts

An Analysis consists of a set of [Views](view.md).
In each [View](view.md) there is a set of [Tiles](tile.md).
A [Tile](tile.md) constains some layout and formatting, in addition to a [Visualization](../visualizations/index.md).
A [Tile](tile.md) can also contain [Actions](action.md).
A [Visualization](../visualizations/index.md) is a way of displaying data. The [visualizations](../visualizations/index.md) differ wildly, but common concepts are [Values](value.md) and [Categories](category.md).
