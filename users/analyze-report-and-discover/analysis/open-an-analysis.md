# Open an Analysis

Analyses are opened from the Navigation Pane, or from the Discover Task Pane.

Analyses can be published as shortcuts in the navigation pane by system administrators. To open an Analysis from the navigation pane, locate the shortcut, and simply click it. To open the Analysis in a new window, right click the shortcut, and select **Open in New Window**.

All the Analyses a user has access to can be opened from the Discorver Task Pane. In the **Tasks** section, click **Open**. In the list of Analyses, Reports, and Data Extracts, locate the Analysis, select it, and click **OK**.
