# Stacked Bar Chart

A *Stacked Bar Chart* can be used in two ways:
* Visualizing one [Value](../concepts/index.md) grouped by a primary and secondary [Category](../concepts/index.md). The secondary category is called an *Auto Series*.
* Visualizing two or more [Values](../concepts/index.md) grouped by a single [Category](../concepts/index.md).

In both cases the primary *Category* will be used to generate *Bars*. 
In the first case, each bar will contain the data value for each object in the *Auto Series*.
In the second case, each bar will contain the data value for each *Value*.

Actions can be applied to Header, Content, Button, Context Menu.
