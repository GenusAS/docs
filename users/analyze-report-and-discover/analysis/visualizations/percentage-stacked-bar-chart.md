# Full Stacked Bar Chart

A *Full Stacked Bar Chart* has the same functionality as a [Stacked Bar Chart](normal-stacked-bar-chart.md).
The bars will all be the same height, so they will not be used to compare the total value of objects in the primary *Category*, but to compare trhe distribution of *Auto Series* objects or *Values* in them.
