# Line Chart

A *Line Chart* can be used in two ways:
* Visualizing one or more [Values](../concepts/index.md) grouped by a [Category](../concepts/index.md)
* Visualizing a single [Value](../concepts/index.md) grouped by two [Categories](../concepts/index.md) where one acts as a Auto Series.

In both cases the primary *Category* will be used to generate *Lines*. 
In the first case, each *Value* will generate a *Line*.
In the second case, each object in the *Auto Series* will be a *Line*.

Actions can be applied to Header, Content, Button, Context Menu.
