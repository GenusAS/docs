# Symbolic distribution

A **symbolic distribution** can be used in two ways:
* Visualizing a single [value](../concepts/value.md) grouped by a single [category](../concepts/index.md)
* Visualizing one or more *uncategorized* [values](../concepts/index.md)

A symbol picker can be applied to choose a symbol to represent the aggregated value(s).

When sorting is enabled, the distribution will be sorted on the aggregated values. This is done regardless of chosen category/value.
