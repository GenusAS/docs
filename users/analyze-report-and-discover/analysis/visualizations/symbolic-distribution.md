# Symbolic distribution

A **symbolic distribution** can be used in two ways:
* Visualizing a single [value](../concepts/value.md) grouped by a single [category](../concepts/category.md)
* Visualizing one or more *uncategorized* [values](../concepts/value.md)

A symbol picker can be applied to choose a symbol to represent the aggregated value(s).

Enabling sorting will only have an effect in the case of categorized data.

*A typical example of use will be visualizing total hours grouped on projects.*
