# Bar Chart

A *Bar Chart* can be used in two ways:
* Visualizing one or more [Values](../concepts/index.md) grouped by a single [Category](../concepts/index.md)
* Visualizing a single [Value](../concepts/index.md) grouped by two [Categories](../concepts/index.md), where one acts as a Auto Series

In both cases, the primary *Category* will be used to generate *Bars*. 
In the first case, each *Value* will generate a *Bar*.
In the second case, each object in the *Auto Series* will be a *Bar*.

Actions can be applied to Header, Content, Button and Context Menu.
