# Ticker

A **ticker** is an animated visualization of a [Value](../concepts/index.md) and its relation to a comparative value.

It can be used in three ways:
* With no value inputs, it will display the name of all the items in the set category. This is the same information as a [Single Category Field](single-category-field.md)
* With one value input, it will display the name and value of the chosen items. This is the same information as a [Table](table.md)
* With two value inputs, it will compare each element to the corresponding element in the other input, and display the difference with a symbol. A constant value may also be used. This is the same information as a [Deviation Table](deviation-table.md)


*A typical use case would be showing the value of a stock and comparing it to its value the previous day.*
