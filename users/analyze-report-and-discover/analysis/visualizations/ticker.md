# Ticker

A **ticker** is a moving visualization of a [Value](../concepts/index.md) and its deviation from a comparative value.
It can be used in two ways:
* With one value input, it will compare each element to its predecessor (e.g. change from month to month)
* With two value inputs, it will compare each element to the corresponding element in the other input. A constant value may also be used.

In each case, the result will be displayed with colors and symbols indicating whether the first element is larger, smaller or equal to the element it is compared to.
A version of the Ticker without animation is the [Deviation Table](deviation-table.md).

*A typical use case would be showing the value of a stock and comparing it to its value the previous day.*
