# Value Grid

A *Value Grid* is a spreadsheet-like component visualized in a tabular form where each cell represents one [Value](../concepts/value.md).  

## Filtering rows and columns
Rows and columns in the Value Grid can be configured with a [Filter](../concepts/selection.md) that will be applied on all the cell values in a row/column, i.e. filtering all the cell values in that row/column.

## Formatting
The Value Grid can be formatted in a various of ways, on row level (applied to all cells in that row), column level (applied to all cells in that column) and on cell/value level (applied to one cell). Some formatting properties (not exhaustive) are:
* Row height
* Column height
* Border format
* Background color
* Text alignment
