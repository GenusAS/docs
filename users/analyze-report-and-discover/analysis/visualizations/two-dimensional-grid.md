# Two Dimensional Grid

A Two Dimensional Grid presents bound data in a tabular format, where columns represent data fields and rows represent objects.  Numerous data management and layout customization features are supported.

The grid allows data to be grouped by an unlimited number of columns. When a grid is grouped by a single column, rows that have identical values in this column are arranged into groups. Each group is identified by a group row. If the grid is grouped by another column, data rows within each group are arranged into second level groups based on the values of the new grouping column, etc.
