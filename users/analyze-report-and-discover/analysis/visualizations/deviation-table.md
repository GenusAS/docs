# Deviation table

A **Deviation table** is used to list a percentage deviation between two [values](../concepts/index.md) grouped by one [category](../concepts/index.md). The table shows the group name, current value and deviation.
The width of the columns can be set by adjusting the *column width* of the category in the format tab of the designer. Sorting can be done by category or value. Adjusting font size and color is supported, as is defining a suffix and number format of the values.

A typical use case would be showing the value of a stock or currency and comparing it to its value the previous day. 

Actions can be applied to header, content, button, context menu.
