# Word cloud
A **word cloud** shows all object in a [Category](../concepts/category.md) with their size based on a connected value
Color for each word can be set on the secondary value

The maximum font size is set by body font. Note that too many and/or too large words will increase runtime.  and might not render at all if the tile is too small

*A typical use case would be visualizing the revenue of a set of companies, with solid colors showing their field or a gradient color for number of employees*
