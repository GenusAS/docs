# Sankey diagram

A **Sankey diagram** is a flow diagram where the width of the arrows is proportional to the flow between the nodes.

In the Genus App platform, it is used to visualize N-1 [values](../concepts/value.md) grouped pairwise by N [categories](../concepts/category.md).
The component accepts 2, 3 or 4 categories (and thus 1, 2 or 3 main values).

In addition to the visualized values, one can specify additional values to be grouped by two adjacent categories. These values will be displayed in the tooltip.
