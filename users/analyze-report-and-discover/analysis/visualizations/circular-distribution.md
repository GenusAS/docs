# Circular distribution

A **Circular distribution** is used to display one [value](../concepts/value.md) grouped by one or two [categories](../concepts/category.md) in a circle. The radial category is used to group the value in equal arcs of the circle, while the linear category slices up the arcs inward. The value is visualized as the color of each slice, calculated using either a gradient between the minimum and maximum data points or conditional colors.

An obvious use case is to visualize when tasks are completed. The radial category would be hour of day, and the linear category day of week. The color would then represent the number of tasks completed at that hour and day.
