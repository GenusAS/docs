# Single Category Field

A *Single Category Field* is a simple comma-separated outlisting of the objects from a [Category](../concepts/category.md) data source.

By default, it uses the naming field(s) of the category data source for naming of the objects, but this can be overriden.  
Sorting and selection is supported.
