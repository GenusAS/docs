# Dropdown

The *Dropdown* visualization is a Multi [Category](../concepts/category.md) Dropdown visualization. It supports n categories, and shows a dropdown for each, containing the objects from the category data source.

By default, it uses the naming field(s) of the category data source for naming of the objects, but this can be overriden.  
It supports sorting by state and selection.
