# Analysis

Analysis lets you discover new information and knowledge from your data, in an intuitive, interactive, and visual way. A [Data Mart](data-marts/index.md) defines the structure and content of data, and loads the data for the analysis, which presents the information in various controls, like lists, charts, grids, etc. When an element in a control is selected by the user, all the other controls show how its data is associated with the selected element. A list will show the elements that are associated on white background, and the elements that are not associated on gray background. Charts will update to show graphs / pies for the selected elements only.

Selected groups of users can be granted permsissions to create new analyses. The analyses are then made available for other groups of users, by granting the necessary permissions. Shortcuts to analyses can also be created in the [navigation pane](../navigate-view-modify-and-control/navigation-pane.md) by a system administrator.
