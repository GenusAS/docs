A Report must contain at least one data source in the **Vertical Axis** field or the **Horizontal Axis** field, and a value in the **Values** field. Often it is necessary to use a time data source in the vertical axis, horizontal axis or as a filter in the **Filters** field, to confine the data quantity.
