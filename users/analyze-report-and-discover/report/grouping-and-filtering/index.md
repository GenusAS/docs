# Grouping and Filtering

Use Data Sources to group and filter data in a report. There are three types of data sources; time, objects and codes. The data sources are used to group the data along either the vertical axis or horizontal axis, and filtering the data in the report. A data source can for example be employee, sales territory, marital status, month, week, or year.
