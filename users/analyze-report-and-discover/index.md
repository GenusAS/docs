# Analyze, report and discover

Genus Apps provides knowledge based analytical processing capabilities (OLAP) and reporting features, making it possible to discover and explore business data from multiple dimensions by pointing, clicking, and dragging, creating and sharing reports and analysis. But most importantly is the built-in support for seamlessly integrating these data discovery features with the rest of your Genus Apps application, making access both ways between detailed data and aggregated data a natural part of your application.

## Main concepts

* **Analysis:** An analysis is a visual representation of data stored in Genus Apps. An analysis is often developed to answer a specific question that the users may have E.g: "What is the revenue in each sector the last six months?", "In which part of the city does most of my customers work?"
* **Data mart:** A data mart is the provider of data for an analysis or a data extract. A data mart is often a restricted, partial view of the data set that is tailored for the data requirements of one or more analyses.
* **Data extract:** A data extract defines the structure and data that should be exported to a file. It uses a data mart as a data provider.
* **Report:** Report is an earlier technology for visualizing data. Genus encourages the use of Analysis for new developments.
