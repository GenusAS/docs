# Analyze, report and discover

Genus App Platform provides knowledge based analytical processing capabilities (OLAP) and reporting features. Explore your business data from multiple dimensions by pointing, clicking, and dragging, create reports and analysis, and share them to make better decisions. Anyone at any business or technical skill level across your corporation can explore large volumes of summarized data with sub-second response times.

In Genus Desktop, the **Report Task Pane** can be opened by clicking **Report** on the toolbar, and contains three sections. The **Available reports assosiated wiht your selection of objects** section displays reports that can be filtered by the objects you have selected. The **Recent Items** section displays the recently used reports, and in the **Tasks** section there are links to open all available reports and to create a new report.
