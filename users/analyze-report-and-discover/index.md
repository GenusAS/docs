# Analyze, report and discover

Genus App Platform provides knowledge based analytical processing capabilities (OLAP) and reporting features. Explore your business data from multiple dimensions by pointing, clicking, and dragging, create reports and analysis, and share them to make better decisions. Anyone at any business or technical skill level across your corporation can explore large volumes of summarized data with sub-second response times.

## Main concepts

* **Analysis:** An analysis is a visual representation of data stored in Genus App Platform. An analysis is often developed to answer a specific question that the users may have E.g: "What is the revenue in each sector the last six months?", "In which part of the city does most of my customers work?"
* **Data mart:** A data mart is the provider of data for an analysis or a data extract. A data mart is often a restricted, partial view of the data set that is tailored for the data requirements of one or more analyses.
* **Data extract:** A data extract defines the structure and data that should be exported to a file. It uses a data mart as a data provider.
* **Report:** Report is an earlier technology for visualizing data. Genus encourages the use of Analysis for new developments.
