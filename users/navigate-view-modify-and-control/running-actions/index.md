# Running Actions

The Action Task Pane is one of the five Task Panes in the Genus desktop client, and is availiable in the main window and in most forms. The Action Task Pane contains commonly used actions related to the objects in the form.

To open the Action Tasl Pane, click the **Actio****n** button in the toolbar. The Action button is a toggle button and can also be used to close the Action Task Pane. Use the keyboard shortcut **ALT+F2** to close the Action Task Pane, or to open it again, if it was the last active of the task panes.

 To perform an action, select the relevant objects in the form, and then in the **Action Task Pane**, click the action.

An Action can operate on one object, a number of objects, or it may not require any objects at all. This should by easily determined from the name and type of action. In addition the action may be disabled if a correct number of objects are not selected, or the action may report such a mismatch when activated.

The actions that are available will vary depending on the form and the type of object it is related to . Typical actions can for example be, <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Set Customer Inactive, <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Export Invoices, or <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Approve Budget Proposal.

Some actions are more intuitively activated from other menus or keyboard shortcuts, and are therefore <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">not made available in the Action Task Pane. Examples of such actions are <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">New Applicant, <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Copy Documents, <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Send Invoice as E-mail, <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Paste Contacts from Outlook.

Special actions to follow up objects are located in the [Follow Up](follow-up.md) section in the Action Task Pane.
