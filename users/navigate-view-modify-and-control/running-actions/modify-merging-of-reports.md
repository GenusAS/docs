## Modify Merging of Reports

If you are granted the necessary access (see [Merging Reports](../../../developers/how-to/merge-data-to-a-document/merge-data-to-a-microsoft-word-document.md) for more information), you may modify which reports are included in a mail merge and how these reports are filtered.

To open a mail merge, in the **Actions Pane** and the **Tasks** section, click **Open an Action**. In the **Open** dialog box, select an action and click **OK**. Alternatively, if you have access to the Directory, in the navigation pane, click the **Tasks** node, and in the table, double-click a task to open.
