# What is a Table?

A Genus Table displays your data on screen in rows, columns and cells. You can use a table to add new rows, delete rows or change the content of your rows or cells.

The rows contain your objects, like your Employees. The columns contain the properties of your objects, like your Employees first names, last names and phone numbers.

The table may be sorted, grouped and formatted in several ways, to bring attention to important issues or otherwise make your table easy to read. You may mix related data into your table, for example to display calculated sales numbers for your employees.

Data may also be organized in matrixes, like the sales quota (budget) below.
