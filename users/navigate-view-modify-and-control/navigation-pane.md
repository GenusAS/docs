# Navigation Pane

The Navigation Pane appears in the main window in the Genus desktop client. You can resize or hide the Navigation Pane. The contents of the Navigation Pane change depending on what view you are working in. Each view offers access to information and tasks pertaining to that view.

The view buttons at the bottom of the Navigation Pane correspond to different views. Depending on the view that you choose, you see a different set of groups, folders and shortcuts. You can change the number and size of the view buttons, but you cannot rearrange the individual panes within the Navigation Pane.

The figure below illustrates an example of the content in a Navigation Pane:
