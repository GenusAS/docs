# Personalize your Genus Desktop

## Change your password

Note that you can't change your password if you are authenticated by Microsoft Active Directory. If you are authenticated by Microsoft Active Directory, your password is the same as the password you are using when you sign in to your computer.

1.  In the **File** menu, click **User Account**.
2.  Click **Set Password**.
3.  In the **Old Password** box, type your current password.
4.  In the **New Password** box, type the new password, and then type the password again in the **Confirm New Password** box.
5.  Click **OK**.
6.  Click **OK**.

## Change the default language

1.  In the **File** menu, click **Options**.
2.  In the **Language** box, select which language to use as the default language. You must restart the application for this change to take effect.

## Change the start page in the Navigation Pane

1.  The start page is displayed when you first start Genus Desktop. To change the start page, right-click a shortcut in the navigation pane, and then on the shortcut menu, click **Set as Start Page**.

## Change the default print color setting

1.  In the **File** menu, click **Options**.
2.  In the **Print Color Setting** box, select which color setting to use as default; **Black and White**, **Color** or **Grayscale**. **Black and White** prints douments in black and white only. **Color** prints documents in full color. **Grayscale** translates colors to shades of gray.

## Change the default application theme

1.  In the **File** menu, click **Options**.
2.  In the **Application Theme** box, select which theme colors to use as; **Default**, **Black**, **Colorful**, **Silver** or **White**. When **Default** is selected, the default application theme is used.

## Turn confirmation on exit on or off

You can let the Genus Desktop ask for confirmation before exiting. This is useful to avoid inadvertently closing the application.

1.  In the **File** menu, click **Options**.
2.  Click to select or clear the **Ask for confirmation on exit** check box.

## Show or hide the Genus button on the taskbar

You can hide the Genus taskbar buttons to conserve space on your taskbar. When you hide the Genus buttons, the Genus icon is displayed only in the notification area at the far right of the taskbar.

Do one of the following:

*   Right-click the Genus icon in the notification area, and then on the shortcut menu, click **Hide When Minimized**.
*   In the **File** menu, click **Options**, and then click to select or clear the **Hide the main window when minimized** check box.

## Change what happens when opening a link

When opening a [link](../../developers/how-to/exchange-data-with-other-applications/copy-and-paste-data.md) to an object, the main windows can be opened at the same time. This is useful if one frequently uses links, as it reduces the time it takes to open a link, after the first time. If the main window is not open when a link is used, the whole application is loaded before the target of the link is shown.

To change whether to open the main window minimized whenever a link is opened, do the following:

*   In the **File** menu, click **Options**.
*   To open the main window, select **Start main window when opening a link**.
*   To only open the link target, click to clear **Start main window when opening a link**.
