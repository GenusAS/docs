# Getting started

Genus Apps for desktop (Genus Desktop) is an application client which requires installation on your computer. The client requires a connection to the relevant application services (Genus Services) over a local network or the internet. Genus Services must be installed on one or more Windows servers. For more information on system requirements, server installation and configuration, and client installation, see [Installation and Configuration](../developers/installation-and-configuration/index.md).
