## Searching for Data

Genus App Platform offers number of ways to search in your business data. Anyone at any business or technical skill level across your corporation can search a large number of objects by simply opening an existing search. You can find objects by providing criteria with a simple search, or you can use a multi-step advanced search to execute more sophisticated search operations. Furthermore, you can search for objects with a given property or a given event, and consolidate the results into a uniform format and listing.

The **Search Task Pane** can be opened by clicking Search in the toolbar.
