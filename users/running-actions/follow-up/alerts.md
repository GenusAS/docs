## Alerts

An alert is a notification to follow up on an item or an event. When you receive an alert, the alert appears in the **Alerts window** used to manage incoming alerts. The source of an alert can be such as a Reminder that is due, a Notification triggered by a specified event or an Agent reporting that an execution has failed.



## View Alerts

The Alerts window is automatically displayed when you receive a new alert. The window will also be displayed when you sign in if there are any pending alerts. If you want to reopen the Alerts window, click **Actions** in the toolbar to expand the Action task pane, then click **Alerts** in the **Follow Up** section.

The following information is listed for each alert:

*   **Type**. Can be one of the following: Reminder, Notification, Completed, Expired, Error or Executed.
*   **Category**. The category for a Reminder or Notification if a follow up triggered the alert.
*   **Subject**. The subject for the alert.
*   **Date**. The date the alert was received.
*   **Object**. The object associated with the alert. For example, if you add a reminder to follow up on a customer, the customer is displayed as the object.
*   **Raised by**. The user who raised the alert. For example, the owner of a Reminder.



## Working with Alerts

*   To open the object associated with an alert, for example a customer to follow up on, click **Open Object**.
*   If an alert was triggered by a Reminder or Notification, click **Open Follow Up** to view the associated follow up.
*   To remove an alert, select the alert in the list and click **Dismiss Alert**.
*   If you don't want to dismiss an alert, you can snooze the alert to receive a notifcation later. Snoozing closes the alert temporarily. After a period of time you will be notified again. Select the alert you want to snooze. In the **Click Snooze to be reminded again** list, select when to receive a new alert and click **Snooze**.
*   Unread alerts are displayed in bold text. Read alerts are displayed in plain text. When you open the object or the follow up associated with an alert, the alert is marked as read. To manually mark an alert as read or unread, right-click the alert, and then on the shortcut menu, click **Mark as Read** or **Mark as Unread**.
