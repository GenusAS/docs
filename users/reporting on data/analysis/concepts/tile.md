# Tile

A [View](view.md) is composed of *Tiles*.
A tile is a layout item which has the following parts:
* A *Header* area at the top where there can be a header text and a subheader text.
* A *Body* area in the middle where there is a [Visualization](../visualizations/index.md)
* A *Footer* area where there can be [Action](action.md) buttons

Tiles are placed by the analysis designer. The tiles has a snapping algorithm to the right border, and a wrapping algorithm relative to the width of the analysis.

Tiles can be maximized design time or runtime.
