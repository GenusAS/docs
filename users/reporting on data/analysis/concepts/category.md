# Category

A *Category* is a set of objects of some type.
A *Category* will appear in [Visualizations](../visualizations/index.md) as an axis in a [Bar Chart](../visualizations/bar-chart.md) or rows in a [Table](../visualizations/table.md)

[Visualizations](../visualizations/index.md) that use *Categories* have different options for controlling them:

* *Allow User Selection* toggles [Selection](selection.md) functionality.
* *Hide Excluded* toggles hiding of category objects that are not qualified in the current [Selection](selection.md).
* *Trim* toggles hiding of category objects that has no data values.

Some [Visualizations](../visualizations/index.md) e.g. [Table](../visualizations/table.md) can use a field of an object in the *Caegory* data source to sort category objects.

Some [Visualizations](../visualizations/index.md) can configure naming of *Category* objects.

Some [Visualizations](../visualizations/index.md) can restrict their output to only a subset of the objects in the *Category* data source by using sorting and then cut after a given number of objects.
