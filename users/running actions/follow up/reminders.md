## Add a Reminder

1.  On the toolbar, click **Follow Up** ![ID2CB1EFA83B4B42E0.ID2E2FE61F5948435D.jpg](media/ID2CB1EFA83B4B42E0.ID2E2FE61F5948435D.jpg), and then click **Add Reminder**.
2.  Type a subject and/or select a category for the reminder.
3.  Type a date and time in the **Due By** box.
4.  In the **Description** box, optionally type a description.



## Advanced Options

1.  In the **Reminder** dialog box, click **Advanced**.
2.  If you want to assign the responsibility for following up on the issue to another user, select a user in the **Delegate** box. When the reminder is due an alert is sent to the delegate. You will no longer receive an alert.
3.  If a delegate is assigned you can choose if you want to receive a notification when the delegate completes the reminder. To receive a notification, select the **Notify owner when the reminder is complete** check box. Note that only the owner or the delegate has access to complete the reminder.
4.  To notify other users when the reminder is due, select users that should receive a notification in the **Recipient** box. The alerts sent to the recipients will be marked with "Cc" indicating that the reminder is for their information only and no response is required.



## Complete a Reminder

1.  In the **Reminder** dialog box, click **Complete**. Note that only the owner or the delegate has access to complete the reminder.

The reminder will be marked as completed and deleted automatically when it is no longer needed (e.g. if a delegate completes the reminder and the owner should be notified, the reminder is not deleted until the owner dismisses the complete alert).



## Remove a Reminder

1.  On the toolbar, click **Follow Up**![ID7ECFA12E4D6340BA.ID13E865AB602845B6.jpg](media/ID7ECFA12E4D6340BA.ID13E865AB602845B6.jpg), and then click **Follow Up View**.
2.  A table showing all follow up's for the object is displayed. Select the reminder that should be removed. On the toolbar, click **Delete ![ID7ECFA12E4D6340BA.IDE63B9C0B7F6E4415.JPG](media/ID7ECFA12E4D6340BA.IDE63B9C0B7F6E4415.JPG)**.

5.  To disable a category, click to clear the **Enabled** check box. This can be useful if you want to remove a category that still is in use. If the category is in use by any reminders you are not allowed to remove the category. However, when a category is disabled, it is no longer possible for users to select that category when a new reminder is added.
