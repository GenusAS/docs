# Search Based on Other Data Sources

Genus App Platform allows you to search for data in a data source based on search criteria in other data sources. These types of searches are not always available or meaningful, but they can be enabled if necessary.

To perform a search through other data sources, do the following:

1.  Select a table, or in the **Search in Data Source** click a data source you want to search for data from.
2.  Click ![ID35FCA62027E544D2.ID17CCA70FCBF34470.png](media/ID35FCA62027E544D2.ID17CCA70FCBF34470.png) in the search field and in the menu, point to Data Source and then select a data source.
3.  Enter your search criteria.
4.  Click **Search**.

Example:

The following example shows a search on Products. Instead of searching directly on the properties of products, we want to find products with certain Internet Sales properties.

Note that the data source Internet Sales is selected, which means that the search criteria is applied to Internet Sales.
