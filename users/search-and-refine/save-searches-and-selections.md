# Save Searches and Selections

You can save your search as a Search Folder, or your search result as a selection for later use. A Search Folder is a saved search based on given criteria, and the result of the search can change over time. Each time you open a search folder, it will search for objects based on the saved criteria. It is useful for example when you want a list over Employees with age over 30\. A selection is a collection of the objects you have saved.

To save a search or selection, do the following:

1.  [Search for objects](search-for-objects.md "Search for Objects") by enter your search criteria in search fields or in [Advanced Search](using-advanced-search.md "Using Advanced Search").
2.  After performing your search, click ![ID849E474FEA2B4213.ID8149198D810A4E57.png](media/ID849E474FEA2B4213.ID8149198D810A4E57.png) in the search field, and then in the menu, click **Save Search As**.
