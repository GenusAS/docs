## What is a Form?

A Genus Form allows you to enter new data by filling in text, numbers and dates etc. in blank fields on your screen. You can also use a form to change your existing data, or simply for viewing data. A form typically contains data for one object, like an employee, allowing you to change values for First Name, Last Name, Phone Number and so on.

A form may display data of different types like pictures, dates, options and code selections, but also display references to other objects and even tables with related data. Fields may be of different sizes, positioned at different areas within the form and grouped in tabs and sections.
