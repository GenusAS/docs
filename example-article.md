# Example article
All articles should start with an H1 heading. An article will typically start with a short paragraph defining the content of the article


## Usage of headers in an article
Subsequent headers are defined by using two or more hash characters in the heading. These headers will define bookmarks in the _In this arictle_ section in the upper right corner.

## Links
Here is a link the [Genus AS](http://www.genus.no) website, a link to the [lists](#lists) section within this article and a link to the section [ways to contribute](readme.md#ways-to-contribute) in the [readme](readme.md) article.

1. Item 1
2. Item 2

It is also possible to use three backthicks to start and end code blocks. These can also be syntax highlighted using a syntax format tag, such as _xml_ after the three starting backthicks.

```python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
```
